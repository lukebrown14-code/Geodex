# Metrics 

To analyze if a country has healthy demographics, you must examine metrics that balance current economic productivity
with future sustainability. A healthy demographic profile typically features a stable or growing working-age population,
replacement-level fertility, and manageable dependency ratios. [bbc.co](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/articles/zvjrqyc)

## Vital Reproduction Metrics

The most fundamental indicator of demographic health is the ability of a population to sustain its size over
generations. [populationpyramids](https://populationpyramids.org/blog/population-pyramid-types-complete-guide)

- **Total Fertility Rate (TFR):** The average number of children born to a woman; "replacement level" is roughly 2.1.
  [populationpyramids](https://www.populationpyramids.org/blog/population-pyramid-types-complete-guide)
- **Net Migration Rate:** The difference between immigrants and emigrants, which can offset low birth rates or drain
  human capital. [populationpyramids](https://populationpyramids.org/blog/population-pyramid-types-complete-guide)
- **Maternal and Infant Mortality:** Key indicators of health system quality and the overall "starting health" of the
  newest generation.

## Population Structure Analysis

The distribution of age groups determines the immediate and long-term economic burden on a society.
[data.worldbank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator)

- **Dependency Ratio:** The ratio of non-working age people (under 15 and over 65) to the working-age population
  (15–64). [bbc.co](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/articles/zvjrqyc)
- **Median Age:** A rising median age indicates an "aging" society, which often faces labor shortages and increased
  healthcare costs. [bbc.co](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/articles/zvjrqyc)
- **Population Pyramid Shape:** Healthy "stationary" pyramids are barrel-shaped, while "constrictive" pyramids (narrow
  base) signal future decline.

## Health and Longevity Indicators

A healthy demographic is not just about numbers, but also the physical capability and well-being of the people.
[oecd](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/health-at-a-glance-2025_8f9e3f98-en.html)

- **Life Expectancy at Birth:** Reflects general living standards, nutrition, and medical access.

- **Healthy Life Expectancy (HALE):** Measures the years a person lives in "good health" rather than just total years
  lived.
  [influenceflow](https://influenceflow.io/resources/measuring-community-health-metrics-and-analytics-a-complete-2026-guide/)
- **Disease Prevalence:** Tracking chronic and infectious diseases reveals the long-term strain on the workforce and
  national budget. [worldpopulationreview](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/healthiest-countries)

## Social and Economic Determinants

Demographic health is also tied to how well a country utilizes its human capital and ensures equity.
[nationalequityatlas](https://www.nationalequityatlas.org/indicators)

- **Youth Unemployment:** High rates among the young can lead to social instability and delayed family formation.
  [nationalequityatlas](https://www.nationalequityatlas.org/indicators)
- **Gender Equity:** Metrics like women's workforce participation often correlate with more resilient and balanced
  demographic trends. [oecd](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/health-at-a-glance-2025_8f9e3f98-en.html)
- **Urbanization Rate:** Rapid, unplanned urbanization can stress resources, while balanced growth supports economic
  health. [populationpyramids](https://populationpyramids.org/blog/population-pyramid-types-complete-guide)
